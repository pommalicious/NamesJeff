First web project. (with bootstrap)

Just learned basic Css,html,js and picking up on twitter. This goal for this project was to learn a framework and incorporate jquery,modals,form validations and make responsive.

I learned that bootstrap is a great time saving tool to use most of which is to be able to not spend much time in the CSS. In regards to being responsive, or "mobile first" I will have to pass on bootstrap.

Too much time was spent on taking things not already responsive on bootstrap, and get them to scale with the things that already were. I would have been able to do it faster had I left bootstrap out completely.
